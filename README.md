# DAVSOD-SSAV-Caffe-Version-for-Windows


This is an unofficial DAVSOD Caffe code Implementation of adapting DAVSOD Linux version to Windows platform, and is tested on Windows10 with CUDA 8.0, cudnn5.0 and Visual Studio 2015.

The official DAVSOD code link: https://github.com/DengPingFan/DAVSOD. 
IF you want to use our code, you should download this code to replace the file folder "mycaffe-convlstm" of official DAVSOD code.
The official original Win Caffe code can be downloaded from: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/windows.

And the dependencies "libraries_v140_x64_py27_1.1.0" can be manually downloaded from: https://github.com/willyd/caffe-builder/releases/download/v1.1.0/libraries_v140_x64_py27_1.1.0.tar.bz2 if the script file ".\mycaffe-convlstm\scripts\build_win.cmd" fails to download automatically when you utilize the file to compile this Win Caffe code.
